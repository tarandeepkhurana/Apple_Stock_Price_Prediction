# Apple Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the **next day's closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL)** using historical stock data and machine learning. It provides both **quantitative evaluation (MAE, MSE)** and **visualizations** to understand the model's performance.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ“ˆ Predicts the **next day's closing price** of AAPL stock.
- ðŸ“Š Displays a **graph comparing actual vs. predicted closing prices** for the last 15 days.
- ðŸ§® Shows **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) and **MSE** (Mean Squared Error) to assess prediction accuracy.
- ðŸ“‰ Provides a **volume vs. closing price** graph to visualize stock trends.

## ðŸ§  Model Details

- **Algorithm Used:** XGBoostRegressor
- **Features Used:**
  - `lag_1` to `lag_5`: Closing prices from the previous 1 to 5 days
  - `return_1`: % change in closing price from the previous day
  - `return_3`: % change in closing price from 3 days ago
  - `rolling_mean_3`: 3-day rolling average of the closing price (excluding today)
  - `rolling_std_3`: 3-day rolling standard deviation (volatility)
  - `rolling_mean_7`: 7-day rolling mean
  - `rolling_std_7`: 7-day rolling std deviation
  - `volume_change`: % change in volume from previous day
  - `rolling_vol_mean_5`: 5-day rolling average of trading volume
  - `ema_10`: 10-day exponential moving average of closing price
  - `momentum_3`: Difference between today's close and close 3 days ago
  - `lag_rolling_mean_3`: Lagged version of the 3-day rolling mean
  - `day_of_week`: Integer (0 = Monday, ..., 4 = Friday)
  - `is_month_start`: 1 if it's the first day of the month, else 0
  - `is_month_end`: 1 if it's the last day of the month, else 0
